# Canvas Defender

This is an unofficial repository of Multiloginapp's [Canvas Defender](https://multiloginapp.com/canvasdefender-browser-extension/) for Firefox.

The commit history was manually created with information from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-canvas-fingerprinting/versions/.

This README and the LICENSE file (according to the license specified on AMO) were created by me, the rest of the source code is the contents of the extracted xpi files, excluding the META-INF directory.
